# CheckItOut

> **Save the song you love the moment you love it.** No screen unlock needed.

[日本語版 README はこちら](README_ja.md)

---

Modern streaming makes it easy to listen — but hard to *remember*. Songs flow past, and by the time you think "I should save that," it's already the next track.

CheckItOut runs silently in the background, captures what's playing from **any** music app (Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc.), and lets you "like" a song **with a single physical button press** — even when your screen is off.

## Key Features

### Instant Capture, Zero Friction
- **Headset triple-click** — same, hands-free
- **Quick Settings tile** — one tap from the notification shade
- **Lock-screen notification buttons** — visible without unlock
- **Home-screen widget** — also works in lock-screen widget area (Android 16 beta)

### Works With Any Player
Uses Android's `MediaSessionManager` + `NotificationListenerService` to read structured metadata from whatever app is playing. No scraping, no hacks.

### "Oops, the Song Changed" Protection
A ring buffer holds the last 10 tracks. When you press the button, `RecentBuffer.bestCandidate()` checks whether the song *just* switched (< 3 seconds ago) and automatically picks the **previous** one. You can also manually go back with the lock-screen / widget "previous" action or the in-app "previous" button.

### Voice Feedback
TTS announces *"Added {track} to {playlist}"* so you never need to look at the screen.

### Music Service Links
Every saved track gets links to **Spotify**, **Apple Music**, and **Last.fm**. Tapping opens the respective app directly (via App Links).

### Export
One-tap **CSV** or **Markdown** export with Spotify / Apple Music / Last.fm URLs included in every row.

### Moment Capture Context
Each saved like can also preserve the surrounding moment: local time bucket, playback position, audio route (Bluetooth / wired / speaker), place label, weather, movement state, step count, Spotify audio-features, and a short lyrics snippet. Collection is **best-effort** and happens asynchronously after the like is saved, so the main action stays instant.

### Local Analytics
The app now includes an on-device **Analytics** view that turns your likes into something fun to browse: time-of-day bars, a day-hour heatmap, a mood quadrant (valence × energy), distribution donuts, top artists/places/apps, and automatically generated highlights such as peak listening time, weekend-vs-weekday energy shifts, and whether you tend to like songs early or near the chorus.

### Selection Delete
Both the recent-playback buffer and the liked-song list support multi-select deletion from the app UI.

### Cross-Device Sync
Pick or create a single `checkitout_sync.json` file in Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or another SAF-backed provider. CheckItOut reads and writes that file directly, which works even with providers that do not expose folder-tree selection. **WorkManager** automatically retries when offline — or hit the manual "Sync now" button.

### Every Like Is a Unique Moment
Liking the same song twice is intentional, not a bug. Each "like" is a separate log entry with its own timestamp and its own captured context. The sync engine preserves every entry across devices — it never collapses duplicates.

### Extensible Sinks
`PlaylistSink` is an interface. The MVP ships with `LocalDbSink` (Room). Adding Spotify Web API write-back, YouTube Music, webhooks, etc. is a single-class addition.

## Setup

### Build

Open in Android Studio → Sync → Run. Min SDK 26 (Android 8.0).

### First Launch (permission required)

> **On Android 13+ sideloaded installs**, you may need to go to **Settings → Apps → CheckItOut → ⋮ → "Allow restricted settings"** before enabling Notification access.

1. **Notification access** — Settings → Notifications → Notification access → enable *CheckItOut*

The app shows guidance cards on launch if this permission is missing.

### Optional Permissions For Richer Context

- **Location** — enables place label and weather capture for each like.
- **Physical activity** — enables movement state and step count capture on Android 10+.

If you skip these, the core like flow still works. Those fields are just left null.

## Trigger Reference

| Trigger | Gesture | What it saves |
|---|---|---|
| Headset button triple-click | 3 clicks within 0.9s | Current / smart-recent track |
| Quick Settings tile | Tap tile | Current / smart-recent track |
| Lock-screen notification | Tap "👍" or "Previous" | Current or previous track |
| Home-screen widget | Tap "👍" or "Previous" | Current or previous track |
| In-app buttons | Tap | Current or previous track |

### Cross-Device Sync

1. In the app, tap **"新規ファイルを作成"** or **"既存ファイルを選択"**
2. In the picker, choose Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive or another document provider
3. Create or select `checkitout_sync.json`
4. Other devices pointing to the same file will merge automatically

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Merge strategy | Union by `syncId` (title + artist + ms-timestamp). Each like is unique |
| Storage model | Single JSON document selected through SAF (`CreateDocument` / `OpenDocument`) |
| Background sync | WorkManager, every 1 hour, requires network |
| Offline | Queued with exponential back-off; auto-retries on reconnect |
| Manual | "Sync now" button for immediate push/pull |

## Known Limitations

- Headset button may be intercepted by the music player; lock-screen notification actions and QS tile are the most reliable triggers.
- Some DRM-heavy apps may withhold title/artist from MediaSession.
- Different OEM lock-screen policies may change how prominently action buttons are shown.

## Optional: Spotify audio-features

To enrich each like with BPM / energy / valence / danceability / key / loudness, register
a free app at <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard> and add the following to
`local.properties` at the project root (the file is git-ignored):

```
spotify.client.id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
spotify.client.secret=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Without these, the audio-features columns are simply left null. The rest of the
context (time, place, weather, audio routing, activity, lyrics snippet) works
unconditionally.

## Roadmap

- **v0.2 "Moment Capture"** ✅ — Time bucket, location, place label, weather, audio routing (BT/wired/speaker),
  activity (still/walking/running/vehicle), step count, Spotify audio-features (BPM/energy/valence/...),
  and a lyrics snippet are all captured asynchronously in the background and attached to each "like" row.
  Open `LikedTrack` columns are designed to be analytics-friendly (flat, nullable, normalized buckets).
- **v0.3 "Reflection"** 🚧 — On-device analytics dashboard is in place; next up are weekly playlist generation (Spotify write-back) and 30-day re-listen nudges
- **v0.4 "Artist Bond"** — Artist deep-dive screen, new release alerts, nearby concert notifications
- **v0.5 "Lyric Snapshot"** — Save the lyrics around the playback position at the moment of "like"
